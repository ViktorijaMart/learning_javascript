# **Learning Javascript**

This is a repository where I keep Javascript exercises I have done (mostly at CodeAcademy).

This repository is mainly kept for myself and is not intended to showcase my knowledge in Javascript.

Although, feel free to explore this folder. It is mostly written in Lithuanian (names of topics and exercises).
